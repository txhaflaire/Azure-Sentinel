  "Description": "[Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/cloud-security-gateway) (CSG) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel exports web and/or email logs so that custom dashboards can be created using Workbooks to visualize events and insights on activities of Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway.\n\nFor more details about this solution refer to [integration documentation](https://forcepoint.github.io/docs/csg_and_sentinel/).\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**.",
